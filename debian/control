Description: Procedural language interface between PostgreSQL and .NET C# and F#
 PL/.NET (pldotnet) adds Microsoftâ€™s .NET framework to PostgreSQL by introducing both the 
 C# and F# languages as loadable procedural language. Using PL/.NET one can enjoy all benefits 
 from .NET and its powerful application development environment and also from a strongly-typed
 functional programming language, F#, when writing functions and triggers written in those 
 languages.
 .
 PostgreSQL is an open source SQL database server.
 .
 This package provides a procedural language interface to .NET C# and F# from
 PostgreSQL. Procedural languages are used to write functions
 which can be called in database queries.
